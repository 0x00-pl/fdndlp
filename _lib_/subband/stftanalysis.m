function y = stftanalysis(s, winsize, winshift)
%
%STFTANALYSIS short time Fourier transform analysis 
%  Decompose the time domain signal into the time-frequency domain signal  
%
%  y = STFTANALYSIS(s, winsize, winshift)
%
%  s is the time domain signal. If s is a matrix, the column of the matrix 
%  will be treated a vector and the analysis will be performed on the vectors
%  separately.
%  y is the time-frequency signal. If number of channels equals to 1, the 
%  the return value y will be a 2-D matrix (frame_number x window_size).
%  If the number of channels is more than 1, y will be a 3-D matrix 
%  (frame_number x window_size x channel_number)
