%STFTSYNTHESIS short time Fourier transform synthesis
%  Sythesize the time domain signal from the time-frequency domain signal  
%
%  y1 = STFTSYNTHESIS(s, winsize, winshift)
%
%  s is the T-F domain signal which should be arranged in a 3-D matrix, 
%  whose size is frame_number x subband_number x channel_number. If s 
%  is a 2-D matrix, it will be treated as an frame_number x subband_bumber x 1
%  3-D matrix.
